                <br>
                <p class="lead">Tertiary Students are struggling to effectively study & take notes. Tertiary students
                    need to be able to take notes and
                    be able to study effectively as this directly impacts the outcome of the work they produce and their
                    grades on
                    Assignments/Projects at their tertiary institute/university. This is because tertiary students lack
                    vital skills in
                    various disciplines relating to studying and note-taking. The outcome of this will be to Upskills
                    students with the
                    skills they need to effectively study and take notes to succeed in tertiary education. This will be
                    done by developing
                    an application that provides students a place to effectively manage their notetaking and study, that
                    also gives them the
                    vital skills they need to effectively study and take notes.

                <p class="lead">The desired outcome for this research is to form the basis of a comprehensive

                <p>
                    As the survey was limited, public data was relied on for learning about the demographics of the

                <h6><i>Who are Tertiary Students?</i></h6>
                <p>
                <ol>Tertiary Students are anyone studying in any form at a university or tertiary provider in New

                <p>
                <ol>Most tertiary students are between the ages of 20 to 39, however there are students both older and
                    younger than this
                    age range.</ol>
                </p>
                <br>
                <h6><i>How many Tertiary Students are there?</i></h6>
                <p>
                <ol>There are approx. 385,055 Tertiary Students in New Zealand as of 2023.</ol>

                <p>

                <p>
                <ol>Students would be the primary impact of this, as their grades and quality of work would suffer. It
                    would also cause
                    mental anguish due to stress and other emotions arising from falling behind. Lecturers would also be
                    a secondary impact

                </p>

                <p>
                <ol>Students would be the primary impact of this, as their grades and quality of work would suffer. It

                <p>
                <ol>This impacts both the student and lecturer equally. For the student it’ll vary depending on the
                    lecture and the class
                    as to if this is a positive or a negative for them. And as for the lecturer, in person, lecturers
                    will be smaller and
                    potentially worse as you’re lecturing to an empty room, or better as you’re able to have more
                    meaningful discussions and
                    engagement with smaller lecturers.</ol>

                <p>
                <ol>This would impact students, lecturers with the quality of work that is being turned in. It would
                    also impact the
                    library staff, as their budgets would be based on metrics like how many students use the facilities.

                </p>
                <br>

                <p>
                <ol>This would impact students and lecturers, particularly the students with their quality of work
                    being turned in and
                    subsequently their grades.</ol>

                <p>
                <ol>This will impact everyone at the university at some point for various reasons, in the context of
                    notetaking, it’ll
                    however have a higher impact on the students.</ol>

                    To further understand the issue and develop solutions, the DMAIC process was paired with the 5 Whys

                    <li>Improve Students Motivation to Study</li>

                <p class="lead">
                    The next step of research was to look at what was already out there that students use. Due to an
                    oversight in the survey
                    an accurate understanding of what notetaking app current and former students use was not gathered.
                    Instead, tools like
                    Google were used to determine the most popular notetaking apps that met three criteria.
                <ol>
                    <li>Milanote</li>
                    <li>Notion</li>

                    Each of these applications were looked at individually through the lens of a university student
                    taking lecture notes.
                    From this, it was determined that they all have their strengths and weaknesses, however there is no
                    silver bullet.

                <p>
                    These applications are great at taking notes and being a place for information to be stored (some
                    more than others),
                    however they don’t address the underlying needs of students and what they are struggling with on a
                    day-to-day basis.

                    The Primary Research focused on identifying solutions to the key problems established in the brief,
                    and the Secondary
                    Research focused on understanding the target audience and the impacts of these problems.

                <p>
                    From this research, the primary reasons behind students’ problems with notetaking and studying were:
                <ul>
                    <li>A Lack of Skills and Knowledge to Manage/Prioritise their Workload Effectively</li>

                        what features they have.

                    The creation of an application to streamline the notetaking and studying process could be a powerful
                    asset for students,
                    for it to succeed it would need to effectively help solve some of the root causes that plague
                    students when it comes to
                    taking notes and studying effectively.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, as highlighted in the research, not all the root causes can be solved by an application and
                    some of it requires
                    societal and educational changes to occur for proper change to take place.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This research highlights that there is a potential market for an application that combines both
                    notetaking and study
                    assistance into one application that is customisable for the student, but before this can be said
                    for certain more
                    research needs to be conducted to truly understand the problem and how it can be fixed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the scope of this project was narrowed down to tackling one or two of the key problems, then that
                    would become a much
                    more manageable and realistic product to be created and brought to market.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Overall, this research has highlighted that there is a need for better support to students
                    transitioning from high
                    school to university/tertiary education, however in its current state, what that support looks like
                    is unknown and
                    requires further research before it can be properly visualised.
