                                In Week 1 we had Two Lectures, A Workshop and Computer Lab.

                                In the Workshop we performed an activity around collaboration and working together to
                                solve
                                an

                                under time
                                pressure, where we had to work together in small groups to identify how to solve a
                                situation
                                where a
                                room had been
                                overbooked with three groups arriving in a short frame of time.

                            <p>
                                In the Computer Lab we did some basic app / file setup with the tools we will use
                                (Figma,
                                GitLab,
                                etc.) as well as an
                                introduction to Visual Studio Code and the basic setup of an HTML boilerplate.
                            <p>
                                We had two lectures this week, the first was focussed on 'Problem Solving and the How
                                and
                                Why',
                                this
                                covered some
                                context around problem solving, as it was the first lecture of the semester it also
                                covered
                                a
                                lot of
                                the basic
                                information around the course in general.
                                The second was focussed on 'Digital Products and Society', this covered the history of
                                Digital
                                Products
                                and
                                Technology. It also touched on where the User Interface came from and how it all started
                                and
                                some
                                key
                                events
                                within history around the creation of UI and the introduction of computers to the
                                masses.

                                We had two lectures this week, the first was focussed on 'The Psychology of Experience',
                                this
                                covered the framework for understanding design research and the various forms of
                                Experience
                                (Dynamic,
                                Complex, Subjective). It also took us through various aspects of experience the
                                Psychology behind it that as designers need to take into account.
                                The second was focussed on 'Document Structure', this covered basic document and
                                typography
                                structures of a website as well as various different aspects and considerations of web
                                design/development.

                                In Week 3 we had Two Lectures, A Workshop and Computer Lab.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In the Workshop we performed an activity where we were given a website and we
                                sitemapped
                                it as a
                                group. This involved creating a spreadsheet of all the links and different pages to
                                the
                                website.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In the Computer Lab we focussed on fonts, and using Figma to play around with fonts
                                and
                                find
                                ones
                                we
                                like. We did this by finding a body and a header font then adjusting the weight,
                                style
                                (bold,
                                italic, etc.), and the line heights. You can see this below.

                                We had two lectures this week, the first was focussed on 'Information Architecture',
                                this
                                lecture focussed on 5 main points:
                            </p>
                            <p>

                            <ol>3. Sitemaps and App Structure</ol>

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It touched on the histories and origins of each of these key points and some key
                                contextual
                                information around them.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The second lecture we had focussed on Fluid Typography. It discussed the origins of
                                typography
                                and
                                went through the history of it, to the point of where it is today.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Amongst other things, the lecture also talked about:

                                Research Project around one of two topics:

                                I have opted to go for the first of the two options and have started working towards the
                                first
                                one.

                                In the Computer Lab we focussed on colours and used https://colorbox.io/ to create a
                                colour
                                palette
                                then export that to figma.

                                We had two lectures this week, the first was focussed on 'Functional and Perceptual
                                Patterns'.
                            <p>
                                The second focussed on Colour Systems.

                                Unfortunately due to course work for PROD101 and some personal obligations I haven't had
                                a
                                chance to
                                watch these lectures yet. I am hoping to catch up over the next week.

                                In the Workshop we focused on Journey Mapping, where we worked in groups to journey map
                                a
                                users journey through signing up to a graphic design tool of our imagination / Canva.

                                In the Computer Lab we looked at intrinsic layouts and worked on a lab activity to
                                design a
                                'card' in Figma, then replicate it in CSS/HTML, you can see this on this page, with the
                                new
                                layout. (～￣▽￣)～

                                We had two lectures this week, the first was focussed on 'User Interface Prototyping',
                                this
                                is where we learnt about the different types of prototyping for user interfaces as well
                                as
                                in general. It also talked about when it's appropriate to use them and what they're best
                                suited for.
                            <p>
                                The second focussed on 'Intrinsic Layouts'.

                                In the Computer Lab we looked at Bootstrap and using it develop a website, you can see
                                these edits here with the Navbar and Accordion now being handled by Bootstrap 5.3.3.

                                We had two lectures this week, the first was focussed a review of the fundamentals we've
                                learnt throughout this term, it covered various different topics from the last 5 weeks
                                of lectures.

                                The second focussed on 'Interactive Components', in it Mark talked about different
                                frameworks like Bootstrap, then proceeded to do a live demonstration of using one.
